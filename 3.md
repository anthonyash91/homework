# What Do The Index, New, Create, and Show Routes Do?

## Index
The index route allows you to show a main/index page. This acts as a "landing page" of sorts where you can provide navigation links for visitors to navigate your website.
```
app.get('/fruits', (req, res)=>{
	Fruit.find({}, (error, allFruits)=>{
		res.render('fruits/Index', {
			fruits: allFruits
		});
	});
});
```

## New
The New route is the page where you can add a new resource to your database. In our example, we had a form that allowed you to create a new fruit.
```
app.get('/fruits/new', (req, res) => {
	res.render('fruits/New');
});
```

## Create
The Create route is what allows you to actually create a new resource in your database. While the New route is the page you go to, to add a new resource, the Create route is what actually allows you to add the new resource.
```
app.post('/fruits', (req, res)=>{
	Fruit.create(req.body, (error, createdFruit)=>{
		res.send(createdFruit);
	});
});
```

## Show
The Show route allows you to show the specific items you've added to your database using the New and Create routes. Each item can have its own page to show the data you've added.
```
app.get('/fruits/:id', (req, res) => {
	Fruit.findById(req.params.id, (err, foundFruit) => {
		err ? (console.error(err), res.status(400).send(err)) : res.render('fruits/Show', {fruit: foundFruit});
	});
});
```
