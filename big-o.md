# What is Big O Notation?
Big O Notation refers to how fast a block of code can run; it's essentially a benchmark for code that takes into account time and memory usage. 

# Contrast Big O with Omega and Theta
Big Omega is the fastest, most efficient way to execute code. Big Theta is the "best" of the slowest, least efficient way to execute code.

# Linear Time Complexity
```
console.log('This is my example')
```

# Quadratic Time Complexity
```
for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
	code
}
```
