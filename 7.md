## What are all the JavaScript Data Types?
Null, Undefined, String, Number, Boolean, BigInt, Symbol

## What is the Difference Between Const Let and Var? Consider Scope ... Give an example
Const is a declared, block-scoped variable that does not change throughout your code block. Let is a declared, block-scoped variable that can be changed throughout your code block. Var is a declared, block and global-scope variable that can change throughout your entire code. Var variables are not as widely used anymore.

## Pass By Value vs Pass By Reference? Why would you say a String is pass by value/ or a value type? Why is an object a reference type?
With Pass By Value, a new copy of the variable is created, and any changes made in the new variable are independent of the original variable.

When we are passing arguments of large size, it is better to use pass-by-reference in JavaScript as no separate copy is made in the called function, so memory is not wasted, and hence the program is more efficient.

Pass by value: The method parameter values are copied to another variable and then the copied object is passed to the method. The method uses the copy. Pass by reference: An alias or reference to the actual parameter is passed to the method

A string is a primitive type whereas an object is a non-primitive type. Since non-primitive types are mutable, they are passed by reference.

## What do Map, Filter and Reduce do? Do they mutate the array you call them on?
* .map() method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
* .filter() method creates a shallow copy of a portion of a given array, filtered down to just the elements from the given array that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
* .reduce() method executes a user-supplied "reducer" callback function on each element of the array, in order, passing in the return value from the calculation on the preceding element. The final result of running the reducer across all elements of the array is a single value.

## What are all the Falsey Values in JavaScript? Why do you think this is important to know?
The falsey values in JavaScript are: undefined, null, NaN (not a number), 0, "" (an empty string), and false. These are important to know so you can use a conditional statement to its fullest power.

## What are Async and Await?
Asynchronous programming is a technique that enables your program to start a potentially long-running task and still be able to be responsive to other events while that task runs, rather than having to wait until that task has finished. Once that task has finished, your program is presented with the result.

## What is an async function?

An async function returns a promise.

## What are try and catch?
The try statement defines a code block to run (to try).
The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.

The catch statement defines a code block to handle any error.
The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block.
