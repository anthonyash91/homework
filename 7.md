Const is a declared, block-scoped variable that does not change throughout your code block. Let is a declared, block-scoped variable that can be changed throughout your code block.

## What do Map, Filter and Reduce do? Do they mutate the array you call them on?
* .map() method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
* .filter() method creates a shallow copy of a portion of a given array, filtered down to just the elements from the given array that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
* .reduce() method executes a user-supplied "reducer" callback function on each element of the array, in order, passing in the return value from the calculation on the preceding element. The final result of running the reducer across all elements of the array is a single value.
