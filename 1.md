## How does the Internet work?

## What does HTML do?
HTML acts as the skeleton of a webpage and is comprised of different elements that form the bare-bones structure of what you see online. Elements such as divs, p tags, and headers are organized in specific ways to dictate how a webpage is structured. For example, if you want to add a button to your webpage, you can add the following to your HTML:

```
<button>This is a button</button>

CSS acts as the genes of a webpage and tells the HTML how to look. Different selectors are defined and used to target corresponding parts of the HTML so webpages can be changed on an aesthetic level. For example, if you have a header element in your HTML with the class of "header", you can then target that element with ".header" within your CSS and change how it looks.

JavaScript acts as the brains of a webpage and tells it how to behave. You can use JavaScript to target certain elements within your HTML and assign to them varying behaviors for when they are acted upon. For example, you can add a pop-up message to a button when the button is clicked by targetting the button with "document.querySelector('button')" and then adding an eventListener to it with "
