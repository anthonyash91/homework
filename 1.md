## How does the Internet work?

## What does HTML do?
HTML acts as the skeleton of a webpage and is comprised of different elements that form the bare-bones structure of what you see online. Elements such as divs, p tags, and headers are organized in specific ways to dictate how a webpage is structured. For example, if you have a webpage with a header, the header element will be placed at the top of your HTML. Conversely, if you have a footer, the footer element will be placed at the bottom of your footer. Where these elements land inside your HTML will dictate where they appear on your webpage (granted you don't use CSS to move them around).

## What does CSS do?
CSS acts as the genes of a webpage and tells the HTML how to look. Different selectors are defined and used to target corresponding parts of the HTML so webpages can be changed on an aesthetic level. For example, if you have a header element in your HTML with the class of "header", you can then target that element with ".header" within your CSS and change how it looks. 

## What does JavaScript do?
JavaScript acts as the brains of a webpage and tells it how to behave.
