## How does the Internet work?
The Internet works by sending collections of data from one server to another when a user requests it to do so. For example, when you Google something, you are requesting information from Google's server to be sent to your Internet Service Provider who then sends the information to your computer. These collections of data contain any and everything that exists on the Internet.

## What does HTML do?
HTML acts as the skeleton of a webpage and is comprised of different elements that form the bare-bones structure of what you see online. Elements such as divs, p tags, and headers are organized in specific ways to dictate how a webpage is structured. For example, if you want to add a button to your webpage, you can add the following to your HTML:

```
<button>This is a button</button>
```

## What does CSS do?
CSS acts as the genes of a webpage and tells the HTML how to look. Different selectors are defined and used to target corresponding parts of the HTML so webpages can be changed on an aesthetic level. For example, if you want to change the look of a button on your webpage, you can add the following to your CSS:

```
button {
  background-color: darkblue;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 4px;
  color: whitesmoke;
  cursor: pointer;
  font-weight: bold;
  padding: 11px 15px 10px 15px;
  text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,.1);
}
```

## What does JavaScript do?
JavaScript acts as the brains of a webpage and tells it how to behave. You can use JavaScript to target certain elements within your HTML and assign to them varying behaviors for when they are acted upon. For example, if you want to add a pop-up message to your webpage when a button is clicked, you can add the following to your JavaScript:

```
document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', myPopUpFunction);
```

## What Is the Difference Between Front-end and Back-end?
Front-end focuses on what the end-user can see and how users interact with a webpage, from the webpage's layout to a drop-down menu to a button that animates when clicked. Front-end development is responsible for the overall visual experience a user has when visiting a webpage. The languages used by front-end developers include, but are not limited to: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Back-end focuses on the technical, server side and overall functionality of a webpage, which allows the front-end to respond accordingly to what the user needs. Back-end developers create servers, databases, and APIs that are needed for a webpage to function properly. The languages used by back-end developers include, but are not limited to: Python, Java, and Ruby.

You can think of front-end as the outside and interior of a car, i.e. how the driver interacts with the vehicle, and back-end as what you see under the hood, i.e. how the car functions as a motor vehicle. Both work in tandem to ensure the user has the best possible experience when visiting a webpage.
