## How does the Internet work?

## What does HTML do?
HTML acts as the skeleton of a webpage and is comprised of different elements that form the bare-bones structure of what you see online. Elements such as divs, p tags, and headers are organized in specific ways to dictate how a webpage is structured. For example, if you want to add a button to your webpage, you can add the following to your HTML:

```
<button>This is a button</button>
```

## What does CSS do?
CSS acts as the genes of a webpage and tells the HTML how to look. Different selectors are defined and used to target corresponding parts of the HTML so webpages can be changed on an aesthetic level. For example, if you want to change the look of a button on your webpage, you can add the following to your CSS:

```
button {
  background-color: darkblue;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 4px;
  color: whitesmoke;
  cursor: pointer;
  font-weight: bold;
  padding: 11px 15px 10px 15px;
  text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,.1);
}
```

## What does JavaScript do?
JavaScript acts as the brains of a webpage and tells it how to behave. You can use JavaScript to target certain elements within your HTML and assign to them varying behaviors for when they are acted upon. For example, if you want to add a pop-up message to your webpage when a button is clicked, you can add the following to your JavaScript:

```
document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', yourFunction);
```
